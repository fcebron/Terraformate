[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-latest%20release-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/fcebron/Terraformate/releases/latest)

The aim of this project is to have a script capable of providing the first system upgrade and install a pre-defined [list of softwares](config/SoftwareList.md). This program was designed to be easily customisable. The features of this script are already provided in a lot of commercial or professional softwares like ansible... My aim was to do the same with a very easy syntax and a minimalist list of requirements, so that it can be used on embeded computers (e.g. raspberry pi, beaglebone...) to quickly deploy a config.

In the end, this script will also take a list of softwares you want to uninstall (usually pre-installed softwares are just a waste of space, so this will automate their uninstallation) and provide minor configurations for softwares installed (ie: deactivate root account for ssh connections,...).

See actual [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the list of implemented features, and the TODO-list (unchecked changes in the changelog).

    sudo ./terraformate.sh [-h] [-n] [-r] [-l file]

Arguments:

    -h      Help menu
    
    -n      No-reboot mode (the script will end without rebooting the computer). Warning! This argument is not compatible with the -r one.
    
    -r      Reboot mode (the script will cause the reboot of the computer). Warning! this argument is not compatible with the -n one.
    
    -l file Take file as the software list to install/uninstall. Default software list is: config/SoftwareList.md.


## Features

The script uses a pre-defined [list of softwares](config/SoftwareList.md) by default. I have put 2 lists of softwares in the config/ folder:
 - The default one: [SoftwareList.md](config/SoftwareList.md), it corresponds to usual softwares that I use on my personnal computer.
 - The dev/work one: [WorkList.md](config/WorkList.md).

The best way for you to use this scritp is to fork my repository (on Github), then clone it into your system, create a branch and modify or add a software list for your personnal usage!


### Script behavior
This script does the following things:
 - Generates a log folder and a log file.
 - Adds Canonical's partner repository to "/etc/apt/sources.list".
 - Checks if "aptitude" is present inside the system (required in the following steps).
 - Uninstalls softwares unticked in the software list (see files in the config/ folder and -l option).
 - Updates and upgrades the system.
 - Installs the softwares ticked in the software list (see files in the config/ folder and -l option).
 - Removes old dependencies with "apt autoremove".



## Disclaimer
This script isn't compatible with snaps, because I don't use it. Don't expect to see this feature in the upcoming versions!

Be carefull, I usually work on KDE environment so I have added specific softwares or widgets to my software list that may install a lot of unnecessary dependencies in a gnome environment (like XFCE, Mate, Cinnamon, Budgie, Gnome, LXDE,...). Suppress-them if you are concerned.

This script has been tested on:
* KDE neon 5.12
* Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia
